Greetings. I'm @chaitalic16. I launched my career as a Junior Software Developer at Sigmasoft Inc. in Bangalore, where Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in SQL, PL/SQL, Snowflake, Python, and AI-driven applications. I also have a keen interest in cloud technologies.

ðŸŒ± Committed to continual learning, Iâ€™m currently focusing on advancing my expertise in these areas, particularly exploring new tools and trends in AI and the cloud ecosystem.

ðŸ’¼ I am open to collaboration opportunities that align with my skill setâ€”optimizing database performance, developing AI-driven data solutions, architecting robust data pipelines, or leveraging cloud platforms for scalable applications. Iâ€™m passionate about contributing to impactful projects and driving meaningful outcomes.

ðŸ“« If you're interested in potential collaborations or engaging in discussions on Python, LLM, Artificial Intelligence, NLP, Flask/django framework, SQL, SQlite, AWS, docker, feel free to connect with me. Iâ€™m always eager to participate in professional exchanges and drive innovation together.
